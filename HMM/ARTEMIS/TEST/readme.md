## Test Repository instructions

#### Test tool & command
Tests will be run using pytest.

#### Sequential test runs
If you have decided to use the sequential test runs feature for this exercise, read the following instructions:
We use the folder structure of the test repository to differentiate structural and behavior tests:
1. Structural test files must be placed in the folder "structural"
2. Behavior test files must be placed in the folder "behavior"

Files in other folders will not be executed!
