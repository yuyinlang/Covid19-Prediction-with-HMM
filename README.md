# HMM programming exercise

This is a programming exercise for the lecture **Introduction to Artificial Intelligence** (WS21/22) delivered at the  Department of Informatics, TUM. The introduced programming tasks are set up to help the students to familiarize with the Viterbi algorithm in HMM.

### Works

- Visualization of Covid19 statistics in Munich and LK Munich.
- Prediction future Covid situation in Munich and LK Munich with HMM
